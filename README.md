Use yarn to run package management
`npm install -g yarn`

To run the app:

- download it from github (zip, clone...)
- run `yarn install`
- run `yarn build && yarn start` to build and run
- or just run `yarn serve` to run the app faster with on memory compilation

After a push to master Heroku will catch it and deploy a new verison in `https://stock-ionic.herokuapp.com/`
